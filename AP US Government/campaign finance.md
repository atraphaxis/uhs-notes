# campaign finance 2/28/22

- see also [[presidential election process]] and [[elections, campaigns, and political parties]]
- pre-Watergate scandal
	- mostly unregulated by the federal government
- post-Watergate scandal
	- Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA I) (1971 and amended in 1974)
		- new federal commission called Federal Election Committee (FEC)
			- to oversee and regulate money being spent in political campaigns
		- limits how much money a person not running for office can give to a candidate
			-  $1000 per election (now approximately $2700)
		- limits how much money candidates could spend on their own campaign
			-  $50,000 per election for presidents and vice presidents
			-  $35,000 per election for senators
			-  $25,000 per election for representatives
		- reasons
			- to "level the playing field"
			- to prevent corruption of elections
- *Buckley v. Valeo* (1976)
	- challenge to FECA
	- spending on campaigns is tied to the 1st Amendment freedom of speech and therefore is protected
	- conclusions
		- upheld the limit on how much individuals can contribute to campaigns because it enhances the integrity of the political system
		- struck down the limit on how much candidates can contribute to their own campaign
- reaction to FECA
	- political action committees (PACs)
		- "separate institutions affiliated with special interest groups at the national, state, and local levels"
		- "as of 1974, corporations, unions, and trade organizations have been able to form PACs" to further their political interests
		- "purpose is to raise as much money as possible to support a candidate or a cause"
		- usually for incumbent representatives
		- "can raise and spend as much money as they want independent of the campaign"
		- examples
			- NRA
			- National Association of Realtors
		- voluntary contributions separate from the special interest groups' membership dues, because the dues can't be spent on political campaigns
		- new FECA limits eventually set on PAC donations
			- PACs treated as individuals and must be registered with the FEC
			- can only give $5000 per candidate per election
			- $15,000 per political party per year
			- individuals can't give more than $5000 to a PAC per year
	- Super PAC status
		- "PAC that is allowed to raise and spend an unlimited amount of money from corporations, unions, individuals, and associations"
		- result of *Citizens United v. FEC* (2010)
		- are not associated with  a specific candidate or party
		- PACs can contribute directly to candidates while super PACs can't
		- 500 members or more
