# hard money and soft money in [[campaign finance]] 3/2/22

- hard money: "money directly given to a candidate, party, or campaign"
	- can be donated by anyone but is regulated by the FEC
- soft money: "money given to a party or PAC for party-building activities"
	- not addressed by FECA because it's not easily regulated
	- organizations can give an unlimited amount
		- how super PACs can contribute so much money
	- examples
		- get-out-the-vote drives
		- voter registration efforts
		- ads that say vote for a specific party
- bi-partisan campaign reform act (2002)
	- aka McCain-Feingold act
	- "attempt to regulate soft money"
		- "ban on soft money contributions to national committees"
	- "revise contribution limits"
		- individuals can give $2000 instead of $1000 to candidates
		- new, higher limits for individuals for donations to parties
		- individuals can't give more than $95,000 every two years in total
	- "mandates disclaimers on ads"
		- "candidates must stand by their ad"
	- "made it illegal for corporations or nonprofits to engage in electioneering communications 60 days prior to a general election and 30 days prior to a primary"
		- electioneering communication: "any broadcast that refers to a clearly identified federal candidate"
- *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission* (2010)
	- challenged the ban on electioneering communications using the 1st Amendment freedom of speech
		- limitations put upon corporations being able to advertise is equivalent to censoring
	- struck down the ban
	- money is speech
		- organizations can spend as much money as they want "provided they don't collaborate directly with the candidate"
