# Thomas Hobbes 8/9/21

- 1588-1679
- [[philosophical origins of US government]]
- born in the year of the Spanish Armada's attempt to invade Britain
- tutored children of English aristocrats
	- Hobbes asked them philosophical questions
	- tried to teach them about why England was so powerful
- what made England a very powerful country?
	- theocracy
	- "role of the sovereign state is to create law and justice"
		- sovereign state at this time referred to where kings were in control
			- kings made decisions for the benefit of the people
		- according to Hobbes, "strong government is necessary to maintain order and stability in society"
- did not believe in the divine right
	- still believed that the monarch's power should be absolute
	- monarch gets power from the people
		- so, laws have to be just and "satisfy the needs of the people"
			- social contract
- questions Hobbes attempted to answer in the Leviathan
	- "why do humans need government in the first place?"
		- "how did people come to realize that government was a good idea at all?"
	- "what is the role of government in the lives of individual citizens?"
- English Civil War and Cromwellian Period
	- 1642-1660
	- gave fundamental ideas to Hobbes for the Leviathan
	- wars between Charles I and Parliament
	- over disagreements about religion and the power of the king
	- Oliver Cromwell ruled as Lord Protector for 12 years
		- republican rule
	- as a result of this, Hobbes' view of human nature changed
		- humankind is inherently evil
- people start in the state of nature
	- ruthless, violent
	- people sought pleasure and avoided pain
		- everyone is equal
		- self-interest
- causes of chaos
	- competition
		- personal gain
	- diffidence
		- personal safety or fear of losing it
	- glory
		- personal reputation
- how to produce order
	- social contract with the sovereign
		- people will eventually want organization and protection from a government
		- absolute monarchy is the only form of government strong enough to protect its citizens
- people give up liberty for safety -> sovereign determines rules -> sovereign enforces rules
	- "all agree to obey -> sovereign must listen to the people -> liberty emerges"
		- results in a commonwealth
