# evolution of judicial review 9/27-29/21

- judicial review: "process whereby the Supreme Court determines if a law is constitutional"
	- [[early US federal judiciary history]]
	- "serves as check on the legislative and executive branches of government"
	- "power of the Court to determine the constitutionality of legislation or executive action"
	- "fundamental role in the system of checks and balances"
- process of selecting a justice
	- Supreme Court justice dies or leaves office
	- president selects a new one
	- Senate judiciary committee runs hearings
		- "do you believe the Court has the power of judicial review"
		- "what is your philosophy of judicial review"
- theories of judicial review
	- judicial restraint/strict constructionism
		- "exercised by a justice who is hesitant to overturn federal law"
		- from a literal interpretation of the [[US Constitution]]
		- most often appointed by Republican presidents
		- examples
			- William Rehnquist
				- Republican
				- appointed by Nixon
	- Framers' intent
		- even more strict than strict constructionists
		- exact language of the Constitution
		- examples
			- Antonin Scalia (justice 1986-2016)
				- Republican
				- appointed by Gerald Ford
	- judicial activism/"living Constitution"/"conventional morality of modern society"
		- "exercised by a justice who is more likely to overturn federal law and work from personal belief when making a decision"
		- most often appointed by Democratic presidents
		- examples
			- Thurgood Marshall
				- first African-American Supreme Court justice
				- Democrat
				- appointed by Lyndon B. Johnson
			- Ruth Bader Ginsberg
				- appointed by Clinton
	- "theory of natural, individual, inalienable rights"/constitutional absolutist
		- focuses on the Bill of Rights (especially the First Amendment)
		- government cannot regulate constitutional rights
		- if a right is not listed in the Constitution, one does not inherently have that right
		- examples
			- Hugo Black (justice 1937-1974)
				- appointed by FDR
				- Democrat
	- justice's personal opinion is unacceptable
		- ipsie dixit: "it's right because I said so"
- how a court rules on a case
	- inspect past court rulings
		- stare decisis: "use of precedent cases to justify court rulings"
	- judicial review applied
	- court tests of legislation
		- strict scrutiny/compelling state interest test
			- "if the court determines that this particular law and this particular case deserves strict scrutiny, 99% of the time the law will be struck down as unconstitutional"
			- two types of cases
				- due process
					- regarding fundamental rights
						- a right is being violated
					- "in order for the law not to be struck down as unconstitutional, the government must prove that they are compelled to pass that law"
						- times of war
						- national security threat
				- equal protection
					- 14th Amendment
						- "all persons must be treated the same under the law"
					- no suspect classification
						- based on race, sexual orientation, religion
					- examples that were allowed
						- Executive Order \#9066
						- Trump's Muslim ban
		- reasonable basis/"balancing tests"/weigh government interest and burden to rights
			- state regulations on interstate commerce
			- equal protection
				- quasi-suspect classification
					- gender
			- "time, place, manner restrictions on speech"
			- examples
				- limitations on abortion
