# issue of presidential succession 3/23/22

- see [[constitutional provisions regarding the executive branch]]
- 1947 law
	- president -> vice president -> speaker -> president pro tempore -> secretary of state -> cabinet offices in the order of their creation
	- relatively moot as any new president can select their vice president (pending confirmation)
