# axon

- a [[neuron]] extension that passes information to other [[neuron|neurons]] or to muscles or glands
- mostly positively charged sodium ions outside
- large, negatively charged protein ions and small, positively charged potassium ions inside
	- negative charge on the inside
- when the [[neuron]] is stimulated, the selectively permeable surface of the axon allows the sodium ions inside, causing depolarization
	- before this stimulation occurs, the axon has [[resting potential]]
		- stimulation must pass the threshold
			- excitatory [[neuron|neurons]] outnumber inhibitory [[neuron|neurons]] by some intensity
	- depolarization causes a domino effect down the axon
		- temporary positive charge on the inside is the [[action potential]]
