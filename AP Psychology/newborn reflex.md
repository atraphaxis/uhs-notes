# newborn reflex

- studied in [[developmental psychology]]
- action-reaction responses babies are born with that go away with time
- includes
	- rooting reflex
		- when someone touches their cheek, a baby will turn their head to the side where they felt the touch, trying to put the object in their mouth
	- sucking reflex
		- if an object is inside a baby's mouth, they will suck on it
	- grasping reflex
		- if an object is placed inside a baby's hands, their hands will clasp around it
	- Moro reflex
		- when startled, a baby will expand their body (as in, their arms and legs move outward), then quickly retract their limbs so they can take up as little space as possible
	- Babinski reflex
		- when a baby's foot is stroked, the foot's toes will spread out
