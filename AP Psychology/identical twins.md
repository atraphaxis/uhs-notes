# identical twins

- monozygotic twins
- fertilized egg splits
	- genetically the same
- always same sex
- versus [[fraternal twins]]
- experiments with them help to answer the [[nature-nurture issue]]
- if raised in the same environment, [[intelligence test|intelligence tests]] are almost always extremely similar
	- 70% similar when not raised in the same environment
