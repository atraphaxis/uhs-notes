# Karl Jung

- [[Neo-Freudian]]
- believed motivations and goals of a person are more important than sexual urges
	- [[personality]] is future-oriented rather than fixed by childhood experiences
- collective unconscious that contains a common reservoir of images derived from our species' past
	- creation of archetypes
