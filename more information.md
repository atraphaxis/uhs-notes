# more information

## what is this?

This is a compilation of notes from **AP Psychology**, **AP Microeconomics**, **AP Macroeconomics**, and **AP US Government** from the 2021-2022 school year. I decided to publish this online because I thought the format of the notes may make it useful for others as a study resource. It covers all terms that were taught in the respective classes with the exception of some very basic concepts that everyone knows. In terms of the notes per each term, this resource is not as comprehensive but should still have the majority of required information.

### format

Each term/concept in a subject has a file, and these files are linked through their content. AP US Government is an exception in that the notes are linked but do not really follow the same "atomic" style as the other classes.

### how did you make this?

I used a free notetaking application called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

## I found an error (or I want to contribute)!

Feel free to suggest changes [here](https://github.com/atraphaxis/uhs-notes)! Here you can also download the entire repository of notes so you can have an offline version. You would need an application for opening markdown files, especially on Windows (see [[more information#how did you make this]]).

## questions?

Contact me at jacobu300@gmail.com, or feel free to ask me in person! Also if you want more information about what is going on here or if you would like help setting up the desktop version of this app in order to get some more advanced features (better search by unit, color-coded graphs, plugin support, etc.), I'd be happy to help :).
