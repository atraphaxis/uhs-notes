# [[utility]] maximizing rule

- rational consumer would spend money in such a way that the [[marginal utility]] per dollar of each good equals each other
	- $\fracMU_xP_x=\fracMU_yP_y$
		- marginal utility of product x divided by the price of x equals the marginal utility of y divided by the price of y
