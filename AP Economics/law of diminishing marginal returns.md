# law of diminishing marginal returns

- "as [[variable resource|variable resources]] are added to [[fixed resource|fixed resources]], the additional output from each additional resource will eventually fall"
	- [[marginal product]] increases then decreases
- does not apply in the [[long-run]] because there are no fixed resources
