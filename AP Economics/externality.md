# externality

- [[market failure]]
- "third-person side effect"
- free market does not include it in the price of goods
- negative externalities are always overproduced/overallocated, while positive externalities are always underproduced/underallocated
- goods with a positive externality should get a per unit subsidy so MPB matches up with [[marginal social benefit|MSB]]
- goods with a negative externality should get an [[excise tax]] so MPC matches up with [[marginal social cost|MSC]]
- examples
	- negative
		- cigarettes
			- free market falsely assumes that the cost of smoking is paid fully by the people who buy the product
			- government is able to make policies to reduce smoking
	- positive
		- flu vaccine
		- education
		- home renovation
