# perfect competition

- all other [[market structures]] are [[imperfect competition|imperfect]]
- examples
	- agricultural goods
		- strawberries
		- corn
- many small firms
- identical products
	- substitutes
	- "price takers"
- low barriers on entry
- no advertisement
- perfectly [[elastic demand]]
	- straight horizontal line
	- marginal revenue equals average revenue
- [[profit maximizing rule]] can also be expressed as [[marginal cost|MC]] = price in this case
- all firms make normal profit in the [[long-run]]
	- at equilibrium, extremely efficient
		- price = [[marginal cost|MC]] = minimum [[average total cost|ATC]]
- inefficient firms are the first to leave the industry
- maximizes [[consumer surplus]] and [[producer surplus]]
