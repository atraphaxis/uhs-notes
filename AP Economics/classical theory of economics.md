# classical theory of [[economics]]

- founded on the philosophies of [[Adam Smith]]
- consumers want to maximize their own utility while business want to maximize profit
- natural market forces (invisible hand) allow the market to fix deviations from the norm
- includes
	- always flexible wages that change with changes in [[inflation]]
	- temporary [[inflationary gap|inflationary]] and [[recessionary gap|recessionary gaps]]
	- [[gross domestic product|GDP]] can never change with changes in [[aggregate demand|AD]], only price level
