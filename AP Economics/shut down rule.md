# shut down rule

- firm should continue to operate in the [[short-run]] as long as price (and therefore marginal revenue) is above [[average variable cost|AVC]]
	- close in the [[long-run]], until the market clears up
- firm should close in the short-run if price falls below the AVC
	- loss is bigger than AFC
	- should exit the market in the long-run
- if the price is above the [[average total cost|ATC]], firms will enter into the market
	- reduces positive [[economic profit]] to equilibrium
