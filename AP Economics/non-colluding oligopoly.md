# non-colluding [[oligopoly]]

- pricing strategies
	- match price
		- causes more [[inelastic demand]]
	- ignore adjustment
		- causes more [[elastic demand]]
	- [[game theory]]
- kinked demand curve (see [[oligopoly]])
	- marginal revenue has a vertical gap at the kink
		- where [[marginal cost|MC]] can change and quantity won't be altered
	- price is "sticky"
