# monopolistic competition

- [[imperfect competition]]
- examples
	- fast food
	- furniture
	- shoe stores
	- jewelry stores
	- hair salons
	- clothing manufacturers
- branding
- sales
- relatively large number of firms
- similar but differentiated products
	- try to capture a segment of the market
- some control over price
- low barriers on entry
- non-price competition
	- lots of advertisement
	- branding
	- service
	- location
- normal profit in the long-run
- inefficient
	- does not have [[allocative efficiency]] because price does not equal [[marginal cost|MC]]
	- does not have [[productive efficiency]] because production is not at min of [[average total cost|ATC]]
- excess capacity of the firm would theoretically allow it to produce at the lowest cost
	- gap between minimum ATC output and profit maximizing output
- short-run
