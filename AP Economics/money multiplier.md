# money multiplier

- required reserve set by the reserve ratio in accordance with [[fractional reserve banking]]
	- rest of the money is excess reserves, which could be loaned and then deposited in the bank again
		- creation of "new" money
- lowering the required reserve ratio is an expansionary [[monetary policy]]
- equation:  / reserve requirement
