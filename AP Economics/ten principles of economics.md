# ten principles of [[economics]]

- how people make decisions
	1. people face trade-offs
		- everyone acts in their own self-interest
	2. [[cost]] of something is what you give up to get it
		- waiting in line for something free--you're paying time
	3. rational people think at the margin
		- everyone makes decisions by comparing the [[marginal]] costs and [[marginal]] benefits of every choice
	4. people respond to incentives
- how people interact
	5. trade can make everyone better off
	6. markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity
	7. governments can sometimes improve market outcomes
- how the economy as a whole works
	8. a country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services
	9. prices rise when the government prints too much money
	10. society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment
