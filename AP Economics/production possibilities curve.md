# production possibilities curve

- PPC
- production possibilities frontier (PPF)
- model of alternative ways that an economy can use its resources affected by [[scarcity]]
- graphically displays trade-offs, [[opportunity cost]], and efficiency
- key assumptions
	- only two goods can be produced
	- full utilization of resources
	- fixed resources (*[[ceteris paribus]]*)
	- fixed technology
- any point inside the curve represents inefficiency and unemployment
	- lack of [[productivity]]
	- recession
	- see point A on the graph
- any point on the curve is efficient
	- full employment
	- see points B, D, and C on the graph
- any point outside the curve is impossible
	- see point X on the graph
- [[constant opportunity cost]]
- [[law of increasing opportunity cost]]

- causes of shifts in the graph
	- change in resource quantity or quality
	- change in technology
- change in trade allows one to produce outside of the curve
- countries that focus on [[capital goods]] over [[consumer goods]] experience more economic growth
