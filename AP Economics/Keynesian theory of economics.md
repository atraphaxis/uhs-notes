# Keynesian theory of [[economics]]

- created during the Great Depression
- [[classical theory of economics]] is correct only to a point
- when fluctuations occur, sometimes the economy will fix itself, but other times it won't
- three ranges of [[aggregate supply|AS]]
	- classical range in which the classical theory most applies
	- intermediary range in which changes in [[aggregate demand|AD]] start to cause changes in price level and [[gross domestic product|GDP]]
		- experiencing a [[recessionary gap]] as economy is producing less than its maximum
	- Keynesian range
		- sticky wages regardless of changes in AD
			- breaks the invisible hand, and economic contraction continues without government intervention
