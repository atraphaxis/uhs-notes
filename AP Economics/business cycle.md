# business cycle

- real [[gross domestic product|GDP]] fluctuates
	- lowest point is the trough
	- highest is the peak
	- time between a peak and a trough is a [[recession]]/economic contraction
	- time between a trough and a peak is a recovery/[[economic expansion]]
- full employment is kind of the average trendline in general
- positive output gap occurs between full employment and the peak
- negative output gap occurs between full employment and the trough
- why does the economy fluctuate?
	- "retailers and producers send misleading information about consumer demand"
	- advances in tech
	- more resources
	- outside influences
		- wars
		- supply shocks
- government is interested in this because they want to
	- promote long-term growth
	- reduce [[unemployment]]
	- reduce [[inflation]]
